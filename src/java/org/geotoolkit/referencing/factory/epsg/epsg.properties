# This file contains custom CRS definitions.  All CRSs defined here will be available
# using the "EPSG" prefix, e.g. "EPSG:53408".
# Note that, strictly speaking, one should not create new CRS in the EPSG namespace,
# but this should not do much harm as long as the numbers chosen are above 50000.

# This CRS is like the EASE-Grid, but rotated such that the USA is at the bottom of the image
