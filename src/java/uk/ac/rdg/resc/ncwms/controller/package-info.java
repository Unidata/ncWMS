/**
 * <p><b>TODO: rework this!  The classes have been refactored!</b></p>
 * <p>This package contains the Controllers of ncWMS, which are the classes that
 * handle user requests (these are the main entry points to the ncWMS application
 * from the point of view of the end user).  The {@link uk.ac.rdg.resc.ncwms.controller.WmsController}
 * handles the requests for WMS operations (GetCapabilities, GetMap, GetFeatureInfo).
 * The {@link uk.ac.rdg.resc.ncwms.controller.AdminController} handles the administrative
 * web application.  The {@link uk.ac.rdg.resc.ncwms.controller.MetadataController}
 * handles requests for metadata from the Godiva2 website (for which the Capabilities
 * document is not suitable).  The {@link uk.ac.rdg.resc.ncwms.controller.FrontPageController}
 * handles requests for the ncWMS "Front Page", which is a simple diagnostic page that
 * provides links to the Capabilities document, the Godiva2 application, the admin
 * application and sample GetMap and GetFeatureInfo requests.</p>
