/**
 * <p>Uses the <a href="http://ehcache.sf.net">EHCache</a> software to cache
 * arrays of data that have been extracted.  This cache reduces the load on the server
 * in cases where clients make the same requests for data multiple times.  This 
 * happens commonly when clients use a tiling WMS interface such as OpenLayers or
 * Google Maps.  Since the cache stores data arrays and not images, clients can
 * make a new request for the same data in a different style: the data will then
 * be loaded from the cache and styled.  This supports the useful functionality
 * of the Godiva2 website, which allows the user to change the colour scale
 * of an image to increase (or reduce) contrast.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is of course important to ensure that the cache remains consistent with
 * the underlying data.  We wish to avoid, as far as possible, the situation where
 * cached data are used incorrectly because the underlying data have changed.
 * The following measures are taken to preserve cache consistency:</p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Each item in the cache will expire after a given time interval, which is
 * settable using the administrative interface (through the
 * {@link uk.ac.rdg.resc.ncwms.config.Config Config} class).</li>
 *
 * <li>If we know the exact file (on the local disk) that corresponds with the
 * given cache request, we check the last modified time and size of this file.
 * If either of these has changed then the cached data will not be used.  (This
 * check is achieved by including these quantities in the {@link TileCacheKey}).  This
 * mechanism is used when a dataset is either a single file or a glob aggregation.
 * It does not, however, work correctly for OPeNDAP datasets or NcML aggregations,
 * because we do not have access to the underlying data files in these cases.</li>
 *
 * <li>For OPeNDAP datasets and NcML aggregations, we check the last modified time
 * of the relevant {@link uk.ac.rdg.resc.ncwms.config.Dataset Dataset} object.  This
 * means that when the metadata for the dataset are re-loaded, all items in the cache
 * that come from this dataset become invalid.  This at least ensures that the cache remains
 * consistent with the metadata holdings.  It will often mean that items in the cache
 * become invalid even when the underlying data have not changed, but this is preferable
 * to a situation in which cached data are used incorrectly.  (The latter situation
 * is still possible but is made less likely by this mechanism.)</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Items are never explicitly removed from the cache by the ncWMS code: ehcache
 * does the clean-up in a background thread using a least-recently-used (LRU)
 * algorithm.</p>
